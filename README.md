## One click installation (recommended):

You can open these exercises in just a few seconds by clicking: [Open in Codespaces](https://codespaces.new/?repo=4GeeksAcademy/python-http-requests-api-tutorial-exercises) (recommended) or [Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io#https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/python-http-requests-api-tutorial-exercises).

> Once you have VSCode open, the LearnPack exercises should start automatically. If the exercises don't run automatically, you can try typing on your terminal: `$ learnpack start`

## Local Installation

Clone the repository in your local environment and follow the steps below:

1. Make sure you install [LearnPack](https://www.learnpack.co/), node.js version 14+, and Python version 3+. This is the command to install LearnPack:

```bash
$ npm i learnpack -g
$ learnpack plugins:install learnpack-python
```

2. Start the tutorial/exercises by running the following command at the same level your `learn.json` file is:

## How are the exercises organized?

Each exercise is a small react application containing the following files:

1. **app.py:** represents the entry python file that will be executed by the computer.
2. **README.md:** contains exercise instructions.
3. **test.py:** you don't have to open this file, it contains the testing script for the exercise.

> Note: The exercises have automatic grading, but they're very rigid and strict, my recommendation is to not take the tests too serious and use them only as a suggestion, or you may get frustrated.
