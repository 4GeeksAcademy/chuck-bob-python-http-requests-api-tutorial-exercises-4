# `09` List of blog titles

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Using the same endpoint from the previous exercise, create a function `get_titles` that returns the titles of all the posts found in the response body.

## 💡 Hints:

+ Create the function `get_titles`.
+ Declare a new empty list called `titles`.
+ Do the request to the endpoint inside the function.
+ Loop each post from the list of posts.
+ Get the title of each post.
+ Add that title to the new list.
+ Return the `titles` list.

The console output should be something similar to this:

```python
['title 1', 'title 2', 'title 3']
```
